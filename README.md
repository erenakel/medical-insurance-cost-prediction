# 📊 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview

This project analyzes and predicts **medical insurance costs** using machine learning. We explore **data visualization, feature engineering, and model building** to develop an accurate prediction model.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- **Feature Engineering**: Categorical encoding, feature selection, and interactions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained a **Random Forest Regressor**, achieving **83% accuracy**.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared with Linear Regression and improved performance.

## 🔍 Dataset

We use the **Medical Cost Personal Datasets** from Kaggle, which contains:

- Age, BMI, Number of Children
- Gender, Smoker Status, Region
- Medical Insurance Charges

## 📈 Results & Insights

✔ **Smoking has the strongest impact on insurance charges** 🚬🔥\
✔ High BMI is only impactful **when combined with smoking**\
✔ **Random Forest performed better than Linear Regression**, achieving **lower error and higher accuracy**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- **Machine Learning**: `scikit-learn` (Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- **Jupyter Notebook** on PyCharm for analysis
